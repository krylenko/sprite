installed:
ROS Lunar Loggerhead (desktop-full): http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Ubuntu
git

expected libs:
-- ROS
-- OpenCV (inc. w/ ROS)
-- NI Kinect or similar for Prime Xtion sensor
-- odroid lib for I/O?
-- lib for joystick control
-- TensorFlow

maybe Bazel build remotely so I don't have to install everything locally?
